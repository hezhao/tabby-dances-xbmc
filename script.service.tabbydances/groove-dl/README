===========================JTR's Grooveshark Downloader===========================

A downloader to Grooveshark's awesome music library. Based off of the wiki at
http://nettech.wikia.com/wiki/Grooveshark_Internal_API.
For now, only a python version with optional GUI is available.

Syntax:
=======
CLI: groove.py 'query'
GUI: groove.py

Dependencies:
=============
	1) Python 2.6
For GUI:
	2) wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org)
	3) ObjectListView (http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/python)

Windows:
========
I have packaged installation files for windows (using py2exe + 7z). Get them from the
downloads section.

Linux:
====== 
You have to retrieve the dependencies and install them.

Building EXEs:
==============
My build script (dist.py) is included in the repository under dist/. Should run under
latest Wine (with native imagehlp.dll) or Windows.
Please do not change the code and distribute until you contact me.

Ports:
======
There's a PHP port by Check over at https://github.com/check/groove-php 

Disclaimer:
===========
I'm not responsible for any violations this script does to Grooveshark's TOS. It's more of a
proof of concept.
